The standard implementation of [PixelStreaming](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/) greatly complicates the development of reactive web applications for Unreal Engine. Initially, PixelStreaming is a no-architecture javascript solution for interacting with reactive web frameworks. Adapting standard PixelStreaming to ReactJS is a very long and laborious process. This process significantly increases the development time, because there are a lot of technical challenges related to the peculiarities of browsers, devices and reactive technologies (like ReactJS, Angular or Vue).

**MetaEditor** streamlines PixelStreaming development to allow businesses to easily deploy and customize their ReactJS application.
